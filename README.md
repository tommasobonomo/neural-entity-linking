# neural-entity-linking

Neural Entity Linking model that implements common architectures for solving Entity Linking tasks, adapted for our specific usecase.
We implement the Bi-encoder, Poly-encoder and Cross-encoder from [Scalable Zero-shot Entity Linking with Dense Entity Retrieval](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.519) (Wu et al., EMNLP 2020).
